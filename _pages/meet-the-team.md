      <p>
          Dr. Xuâ€™s career has centered on developing computational methods for the study of cellular systems using imaging and omics data. 
          He started his research career in the field of Computational Biology and Bioinformatics since 2000. 
          He developed machine learning methods for gene selection for classifying cancer samples, for cancer gene network module discovery, and for sample phenotype prediction through integration of hundreds of gene expression datasets. 
          Since 2008, he started working in the field of computational analysis of Cellular Cryo-Electron Tomography (Cryo-ET) data.
          He designed structural pattern mining methods and first demonstrated the feasibility of De Novo extraction of structures and spatial organizations of macromolecular complexes in single cells using Cryo-ET data.
          His current research focus on Cryo-ET derived modelling of cellular organization at molecular resolution.
